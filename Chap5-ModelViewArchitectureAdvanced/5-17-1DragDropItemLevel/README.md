# Drag and Drop in PySide6

This project demonstrates how to implement drag and drop functionality in PySide6 using different view types (ListView, TableView, and TreeView) with various drag and drop permission combinations.

## Project Overview

The application displays three different views side by side:

1. **ListView**: Can drag items from it and can drop items into it
2. **TableView**: Can drag items from it but cannot drop items into it
3. **TreeView**: Cannot drag items from it but can drop items into it

Each view shares the same model containing four items with different drag and drop permissions:

1. **Item0**: Can be dragged and can accept drops
2. **Item1**: Can be dragged but cannot accept drops
3. **Item2**: Cannot be dragged but can accept drops
4. **Item3**: Cannot be dragged and cannot accept drops

This setup allows for testing different combinations of drag and drop behaviors in Qt views.

## Project Structure

```
drag_and_drop_demo/
│
├── main.py        # Application entry point
├── widget.py      # Main widget with the views and model
└── ui_widget.py   # Generated UI code from widget.ui
```

## Building and Running the Project

1. Generate the UI Python file from the widget.ui file:
   ```bash
   pyside6-uic widget.ui -o ui_widget.py
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Implementation Details

### Setting Up the Model

The project uses `QStandardItemModel` with custom `QStandardItem` objects:

```python
# Create a standard item model
self.model = QStandardItemModel(self)

# Create item 0 - Can Drag, Can Drop
item0 = QStandardItem()
item0.setDragEnabled(True)
item0.setDropEnabled(True)
item0.setText("Item0 [CAN DRAG] [CAN DROP]")
```

### Configuring View Drag and Drop Behavior

Each view is configured with different drag and drop permissions:

```python
# Configure ListView - Can Drag and Can Drop
self.ui.listView.setAcceptDrops(True)
self.ui.listView.setDragEnabled(True)
self.ui.listView.setModel(self.model)

# Configure TableView - Can Drag but Can't Drop
self.ui.tableView.setAcceptDrops(False)
self.ui.tableView.setDragEnabled(True)
self.ui.tableView.setModel(self.model)

# Configure TreeView - Can't Drag but Can Drop
self.ui.treeView.setAcceptDrops(True)
self.ui.treeView.setDragEnabled(False)
self.ui.treeView.setModel(self.model)
```

## Key Concepts

### Drag and Drop in Qt

Qt provides built-in support for drag and drop operations through its views and model classes. The drag and drop functionality is controlled at two levels:

1. **View Level**: Controls whether a view supports dragging items from it or dropping items into it
2. **Item Level**: Controls whether a specific item can be dragged or can accept drops

### View-Level Configuration

To configure drag and drop at the view level:

- **`setDragEnabled(bool)`**: Enables or disables dragging from the view
- **`setAcceptDrops(bool)`**: Enables or disables dropping into the view

### Item-Level Configuration

To configure drag and drop at the item level (with `QStandardItem`):

- **`setDragEnabled(bool)`**: Allows or prevents dragging of a specific item
- **`setDropEnabled(bool)`**: Allows or prevents dropping onto a specific item

### Shared Model

All three views in this demo share the same model, which means:

1. Changes made in one view (like dragging and dropping) are reflected in all views
2. The same item has the same drag/drop properties regardless of which view it's displayed in

## Usage Examples

You can experiment with different drag and drop behaviors:

1. **Drag from ListView to TreeView**: This should work because ListView has drag enabled and TreeView has drop enabled
2. **Drag from TableView to ListView**: This should work for the same reason
3. **Drag from TreeView to anywhere**: This won't work because TreeView has drag disabled
4. **Drop onto TableView**: This won't work because TableView has drop disabled
5. **Drag Item2 from ListView**: This won't work because Item2 has drag disabled
6. **Drop onto Item1 in ListView or TreeView**: This won't work because Item1 has drop disabled

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the flexibility of Qt's drag and drop system, showing how permissions can be set at both view and item levels. The same principles apply to more complex models and views, making it possible to implement sophisticated drag and drop behaviors in PySide6 applications.
